# Amberphylaxis-L4D2-Config
My config for l4d2, feel free to edit as you please or use as a guide for your own config.

//Put file in Steam\steamapps\common\left 4 dead 2\left4dead2\cfg
//Make sure the file is called autoexec.cfg, not autoexec.cfg.txt or autoexec.txt or autoexec(1)
//If file extensions are hidden, make sure to turn them on.
